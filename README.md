# rubiks-cube
My attempt at making some kind of Rubik's Cube game/solver.

My actual goal is to learn how to solve a Rubik's Cube without Googling anything related to the Cube itself. I'm hoping that by creating a Rubik's cube solver, maybe I can watch what it does to gain some insight into how I can solve it myself. My initial solver will likely be mostly/all random guess and check. Hopefully that algorithm will actually solve it, but we'll see when we get there. Also the User Interface will probably be terrible. Maybe I can polish that up at some point, but we'll see.
